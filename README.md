# Brain-Tumor-Detection
We use U-Net, ResNet, and AlexNet on two brain tumor segmentation datasets: the Bangladesh Brain Cancer MRI Dataset (6056 images) and the combined Figshare-SARTAJ-Br35H dataset (7023 images). U-Net enables precise segmentation, while ResNet and AlexNet aid in classification, enhancing tumor detection and advancing diagnostic research.
